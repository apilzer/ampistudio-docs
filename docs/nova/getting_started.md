To ensure Nova charges properly, please make sure the power switch is in the "On" position when plugging in to charge.

The color of the slider indicates power status. When the green is visible, the device is on; when the red is visible, it is off.

When you power on Nova for the first time, it will automatically be in pairing mode. You can connect to your computer the same way as any other bluetooth device. For specific instructions for your computer, please contact the computer's manufacturer.
