# Keycaps
If you configured Nova without keycaps, you will need to install them. Nova can accept any choc style keycaps with standard or smaller than choc 18x17 spacing. The MBK profile is the most commonly used choc keycap. 

To install a keycap, allign the 2 pins on the cap with the holes on the switch and press down.
