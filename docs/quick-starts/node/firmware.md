# Firmware
Node comes pre-flashed with ZMK firmware and a default keymap. With the nature of a small keyboard like Node, you're likely interested in making a custom keymap for it.

We have created a template repository for Node that you can copy to configure the keymap yourself. If you are interested in setting up ZMK from scratch, you can follow the ZMK documentation.

After copying the template repository, the firmware will be automatically built using GitHub Actions. You can edit the node.keymap file to customize your layout.
