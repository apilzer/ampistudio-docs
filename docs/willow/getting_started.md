To ensure Willow charges properly, please make sure the power switch is in the "On" position when plugging in to charge.

The power switch is located on the back of the left side of the keyboard. When the switch is pushed towards the outside of the board, the keyboard is on, when it is pushed towards the inside, the keyboard is off.
