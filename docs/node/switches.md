# Switches
If you configured Node without switches, you will need to install them. Node is compatible with any Kailh Choc V1 switches. Please note that Choc V2 switches are not compatible and will not fit.

To install a switch, align the switch over the cutout in the plate in the correct orientation. The 2 pins on the bottom of the switch need to align with the holes in the socket. Ensure the pins on the switch are straight, then gently press the switch into the plate. This should not requires excessive effort, if it does not go in easily, lift the switch out and check that nothing is obstructing the socket.
