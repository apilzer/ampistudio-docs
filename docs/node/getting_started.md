Node is a 36 key split keyboard with choc hotswap switches. Node arrives fully assembled, but may not be fully charged when it arrives. You can easily charge each half of Node by plugging in using a standard USB-C cable.

To ensure Node charges properly, please make sure the power switch is in the "On" position when plugging in to charge.

The color of the slider indicates power status. When the green is visible, the device is on; when the red is visible, it is off.

Node communicates with your computer via bluetooth. The left half connects directly to your computer and the right half communicates with the left. 

When you power on Node for the first time, it will automatically be in pairing mode. You can connect to your computer the same way as any other bluetooth device. For specific instructions for your computer, please contact the computer's manufacturer.
